Title: About
Slug: about
My name is **Hao Cen**, a programmer, fan of coding and technophile.

I enjoy writing code to build something interesting and solving challenging problems. Everytime I manage to solve a difficult problem, I always have a feeling that **some corner of my world is lighten up**.

I'm now in Canada, though I was born and raised in China. There I obtained my B.Eng degree from South China Normal University and my M.Sc degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Most of my working experience are in Linux backend and web development, and I'm always willing to learn more.

Feel free to contact me at **cenhao123[at]gmail.com**.
