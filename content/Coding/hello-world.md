**This post is for testing only!**

I think I should at least have one blog about coding.

The reason I need this is that Pelican is not clever enough to create a category for an empty folder. I found that under small screen devices like iPhone 5 (When did 5 inches becomes not enough), the content will be display incorrectly. And I need the nav bar to contain more items so as to see the acutal effect.

I guess we all see this code of some forms.

	:::C
	#include <stdio.h>

	main(void) {
	    printf("Hello world!\n");
	}

Let's see what I'll get.

This is really a stupid post. :(
