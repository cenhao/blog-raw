Title: New Year Resolution
Slug: new-year-resolution

As the new year is coming, it's time to make a new year resolution(as always). But the different this time is that I'm going to write down a blog on it.

Usually the resolution would be a little bit beyond the ablity, a little bit unrealistic. But by making a higher expectation to myself, it would be more possible to achieve a higher goal.

So the resolution for 2015:

- Improve my english

	English has been a very big obstacle in my everyday work and everyday life. I tested the size of vocabulary and it is around 6k to 7k, I think I will need at least 15k vacabulary to live a normal life in Vancouver. So let's push the vocabulary to 10k in 2015. Read more, listen more, speak more and write more.
	
- Operating system knowledge

	The OS course in my undergraduate is crap. I don't even remember a single word he said. But this is a very fundamental subject in CS, I think I must pick it up to become a better programmer. I brought the Operating System 9E with me, and it should be read from cover to cover in 2015.
	
- Language

	By language of course I mean programming language. Learn Python && Javascript(including Node.js or IO.js) properly.
	
- Workout

	Exercise for 3 times every 4 days.
	
- Math

	My math background is so weak that I don't remember how to do calculas... But I always know that math is super important. Calculas, probablity theory & statistic will be of my first choices. I'm going learn calculas again as it's a prerequisite to almost all the other math stuff.
	
- Algo & online coding

	TC, CF, USACO, again!

And BTW I bought a PS4 on the boxing day with a 40 inches 1080P tv. I was play `Assassin's Creed: Unity` and the view is awesome!

So there's one last thing:

- Control myself & no to be addictive to games.
